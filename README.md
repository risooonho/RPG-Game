RPG-Game
========

RPG Game using pygame

Here are some features I am hoping to add soon:
1. Rooms (this will be done by creating some functions that create different rooms)
2. Eventually a scrolling background so we can travel outside
	a. I suppose we can also do this using rooms instead of a scrolling background
3. Health and Mana
4. A fireball sprite, I have the spritesheet I just need to do some MSPaint magic (oh yeah paint!)
5. A monster that can attack.
	a. Probably will just get hurt by the monster running into the player (ala zelda)
	b. Later will come projectile monsters
6. An inventory
7. An item class that we can implement to have different types of elements.
